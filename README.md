# Loan Prediction

This repository contains the data and Jupyter notebook for the Loan Prediction Hackathon challenge hosted by Analytics Vidhya ([https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/)).

## Data science process

The data science process followed in the notebook is:
  1. Loading the data
  2. Understanding the variables.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  4. Feature Engineering.
  5. Generating machine learning models.
  6. Tuning the machine learning model parameters.
  7. Generating a CSV file for submission.

The challenge is still on and I am still working on a better model. 
The current model I have (**Random forest model**) has a maximum accuracy of **78%**, which ranks me at position **3708 out of 8383 participants**. 

Working is still up and running!


Happy coding!
